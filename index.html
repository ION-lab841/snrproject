  <h1>Welcome to the Math HL 1 Midterm Study Guide</h1>
 <center>
 <p id="box1"><b>Topic 1:</b><i> Functions</i></p>
 <p id="p1"><b>Overview</b>: This topic introduces the concept of a function as a relationship between variables, using set notations and graphing. The topic contains domain and range, function notation, and types of functions such as linear, quadratic, exponential, and piecewise. Throughout this exploration students will gain the ability to transform functions through translations, reflections, and stretches. </p>

<p id="box1"><b>Topic 2:</b><i> Quadratic and Absolute Value Functions</i></p>
 <p id="p1"><b>Overview</b>: In this unit it covers quadratic and absolute value functions, focusing on solving inequalities by first converting them into equations and using test points to determine valid intervals. For quadratic inequalities, the discriminant helps identify the number of solutions, while the sum and product of roots provide more information about the equations' behavior. Absolute value expression and solved by breaking up the absolute value expression into its positive and negative cases. With transformations like g(x)=∣f(x)∣ reflecting graph parts above the x-axis. The notes also highlight how squaring or applying absolute values to functions alters their graphs, affecting y-values and symmetry.

<p id="box1"><b>Topic 3:</b><i> Polynomial and Rational Functions</i></p>
 <p id="p1"><b>Overview</b>: This topic introduces various methods of finding the roots/zeros of a rational function of any exponential power. This topic features synthetic division, remainder theorem, product and sum, etc. Throughout this exploration, students will gain the ability to simplify rational functions to any power to its zeroes as well as find where the intersection of the x-axis are located.

<p id="box1"><b>Topic 4:</b><i> Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</i></p>
 <p id="p1"><b>Overview</b>: This topic introduces the new functions in the form of exponential and logarithmic. This topic features converting exponential functions to logarithmic function and vice versa. Additionally students are introduced to exponential and logarithmic laws for solving and rewriting these functions. Throughout the exploration, students will gain the ability to solve and graph logarithmic and exponential functions. </p>

<p id="box1"><b>Topic 5:</b><i> Sequences, Series, and Methods of Proof</i></p>
 <p id="p1"><b>Overview</b>: This topic introduces arithmetic and geometric sequences and series as well as proof by induction and contradiction. This topic features finding the common difference or ratio between each number in the series and finding any specific term in the series as well as the sum of the series. Throughout the exploration, students will gain the ability to work with arithmetic and geometric series as well as prove mathematical statements with contradiction and induction. </p>
